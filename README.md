# Introducing SafeWalk

An application to make your walk home safer. We wanted to help people who had to walk through potentially dangerous areas and did not have a reliable way of knowing which routes to avoid. Many GPS apps only find the 'fastest' route.

We allow users to find the safest route from point A to point B. The safest route is based on historical data points, as well as user input regarding safety concerns.  

We built the app using AWS Location, AWS Routes, Google Maps, along with Next.js and Flask.

## Part of Le-Laf Hackathon 2023

24 hours to create an application that helps the local community in education, safety, infrastructure, or mental health.
